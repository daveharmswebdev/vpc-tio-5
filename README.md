# TIO-5

These scripts are for the setup and teardown of the VPC, subnets
gateways, route tables and ec2 instances as required by the TIO-5
exercise.

Please check the commit history, as this will illustrate how these
scripts were composed. 

If you are trying to execute these scripts on your own you will
have to have [AWS CLI installed and configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

Each script will have to modified to be made an executable.  For example:

```bash
chmod +x test.sh
```
